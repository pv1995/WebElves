                A good e-commerce website development company builds a website that will offer all the means and more for the customer and the merchant to get involved in a fruitful transaction.<br>
                Here are the top 10 features of an e-commerce website which you should look out for:
            </p>
            <h5 class="mid-headers">Shopping Cart</h5>
            <p class="lato text-justify">
                This is an integral part of any e-commerce store. A flexible cart allows both the guest user and registered user to checkout.<br>
                There are also some features like “Quick Checkout” which help in a faster transaction or sale and also creates an amazing user experience.
            </p>
            <h5 class="mid-headers">Payment Gateway Integrations</h5>
            <p class="lato text-justify">
                A good e-commerce website gives you an option of integrating with diverse payment gateways by not limiting your choices to a selected few.<br>
                Some examples of widely used payment gateways are:
            </p>
            <ul class="text-justify lato">
                <li>
                    Paypal
                </li>
                <li>
                    PayU
                </li>
                <li>
                    Razorpay
                </li>
                <li>
                    Instamojo
                </li>
                <li>
                    Stripe
                </li>
                <li>
                    Skrill
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h5 class="mid-headers">Order Management</h5>
            <p class="lato text-justify">
                A wholesome order management panel simplifies the task of the merchants where one can get detailed information regarding Buyer Cancellation/Refunds/COD verification/Exchange/Order Status Updates and more.<br>
                This helps in analytics and tracking buyers and also helps in retargeting with the customers.
            </p>
            <h5 class="mid-headers">Security</h5>
            <p class="lato text-justify">
                This feature is one of the most important features as it ensures that no crucial data is saved and for all prepaid shipments the checkout is carried out through a secure payment gateway. All web pages should be protected by SSL.
            </p>
            <h5 class="mid-headers">Scalable Infrastructure</h5>
            <p class="lato text-justify">
                Your hosting infrastructure, as well as microservices, should be able to scale as you get more and more traffic. A higher latency leads to drops in transaction rates and leads to loss of marketing dollars.
            </p>
            <h5 class="mid-headers">Mobile Compatibility</h5>
            <p class="lato text-justify">
                Great e-commerce websites usually offer high standards for mobile compatibility. One should ensure that the mobile view is responsive and properly accommodated according to the device. Hybrid apps are a cost-effective way to build for both web as well as mobile view.
            </p>
            <h5 class="mid-headers">Reports</h5>
            <p class="lato text-justify">
                The reports should be available as exports which contain detailed information regarding the orders, customer database, and product reports in terms of the catalogue. It is quite useful for analysing the growth of the business and to track customers based on buying frequency, products they like, etc.
            </p>
            <h5 class="mid-headers">Communications</h5>
            <p class="lato text-justify">
                Provisions to send and receive timely notifications regarding your orders is of utmost importance. This way a merchant can keep his customers informed about the status of the order and receive the same via the system.
                <br>
                Push notifications are an engaging way to keep customers informed about their orders and also about new product releases and other offers. With a simple click of a button, a customer can subscribe to notifications from the website.
            </p>
            <h5 class="mid-headers">Content Management System (CMS)</h5>
            <p class="lato text-justify">
                Content Management System is used to manage the website content such as logo, banners, footer links, policies, and products from the back end itself.
                <br>
                This helps in modifying the website without any coding interference and increases the usability for merchants. It also helps them advertise hot products or most selling products dynamically throughout the website.
            </p>
            <h5 class="mid-headers">Logistics Integration</h5>
            <p class="lato text-justify">
                Integrating logistics services allows not only seamless shipping but also ensures that the merchant and the consumer get real-time order updates along with order tracking capability.
            </p>
            <p class="lato mt-5 text-justify">
                While this e-commerce features list is essential to make your business stand out from your competitors, a few of them may not apply to your line of business. So, make sure you choose a reputed ecommerce website development company, who understands your business and provides you with best solution.
