                “If everything yells for your viewer’s attention, nothing is heard.” 
            </p>
            <p class="lato text-justify">
                To summarise: Overwhelming your visitors with too many choices or in-your-face elements and animations is “Not to do.” Instead, make sure your “To do” list is full of intriguing design choices that mesmerise your audience and do their part to amplify your brand.

            <h5 class="mid-headers">Broken grids and asymmetrical layouts</h5>
            <p class="lato mt-5 text-justify">
                The grid system in design terms is an imaginary plane with horizontal and vertical lines, used to help layout elements on the screen. With most websites, the grid is easy to point out by simply navigating through it. Whereas with a broken grid layout, you have items that move around on this plane in a way that makes the grid feel less rigid, or broken. This type of design favours the unexpected, Asymmetrical balance, and experimenting with asymmetry in design components. It’s been used as a technique to help stand out from the crowd, to draw attention, or to otherwise experiment with design.<br>
                Take a look at some of the websites that have taken this approach:
            </p>
            <div class="blog-inner-img">
                <img src="/images/grids.jpeg" alt="UI/UX Design Firm"/>
            </div>
            <h5 class="mid-headers">Fluid design and elements</h5>
            <p class="lato mt-5 text-justify">
                Rounded corners and more natural lines are frequenting website designs everywhere on elements like text boxes, image frames, buttons, and abstract element as backgrounds. Designers are  starting to experiment with more fluid shapes and lines. Fluid or organic shapes, aren’t circle, square, rectangle, or any straight-sided shape conventionally used in flat design.
            </p>
            <p class="lato text-justify">
                Adding to its popularity, instead of fixed columns and widths, a fluid website is built on relative widths, grids and percentages. This allows the website to scale up and down fluidly making it responsive.
            </p>
            <p class="lato text-justify">
                Whereas responsive sites use media queries to control the design and content as it scales up or down on the device. They also have breakpoints and set containers, so you have consider different "breakpoints" for a variety of screen sizes. Fluid websites do not have breakpoints or set containers.<br>
                Here are a few examples:
            </p>
            <div class="blog-inner-img">
                <img src="/images/fluid-design.jpeg" alt="Graphic Design Agency"/>
            </div>
            <h5 class="mid-headers">Nostalgia/Retro design aesthetic</h5>
            <p class="lato mt-5 text-justify">
                “Old is gold”, as rightly believed. What is old is new again in the design world. Experimentation with nostalgia and retro design styles can create a nice balance between then and now design. Many websites embrace this design styles that lend themselves from the 60’s-70’s, both in the design of the websites themselves and in the content. Some of these throwback elements include colour schemes reminiscent of design trends of the past or typography that makes us think back to a different time or both.<br>
                Here are a few references:
            </p>
            <div class="blog-inner-img">
                <img src="/images/retro.jpeg" alt="UI/UX Design Company"/>
            </div>
            <h5 class="mid-headers">Monochromatic and splashes of colour</h5>
            <p class="lato mt-5 text-justify">
                Having bold colour schemes is one way to make your website standout as the internet is overloaded with content. Colours have a big impact on how your audience views your website. Hence, Your choice of a colour palette for your brand should be guided by the emotions you want to convey, the standards of your industry, as well as the message you hope to communicate via your business’ visual identity.
            </p>
            <p class="lato text-justify">
                One of the biggest trends coming into 2019 is the usage of bright colours. Bright colours capture your audiences’ attention and gets them engaged with your page.On another end of the spectrum, an upcoming trend is a black and white palette with bold colour accents. Black and white palettes add a unique experience to your website.
            </p>

            </div>
            <h5 class="mid-headers">Typography</h5>
            <p class="lato mt-5 text-justify">
                Typography is a crucial part of user experiences for your site. You must have readable typography to ensure your audience can read your text. In 2019, however, it’s time to step outside the (text) box font now are being used as attention-grabbing centrepieces. Fonts can be intentional statements on their own, with the more artistic and detailed versions capable of sending a message of seriousness, or whimsical fun.
            </p>
            <p class="lato text-justify">
                Popular trend in typography is unique fonts, ranging from the vintage fonts to the bold strokes and the graceful arc of the alphabet in script.
            </p>
            <p class="lato text-justify">
                The combination of several fonts (although never more than three!) on your page lets you assign each one to a specific aspect of your page, another way is variable font-weight of the same font to create a visual hierarchy on your website.
            </p>
            <h5 class="mid-headers">Micro-Animations</h5>
            <p class="lato mt-5 text-justify">
                Animation has been a growing trend over the last few years, with features like parallax scrolling becoming quite common amongst web designers . Yet, in 2019, animation is now appearing in a different dimension with subtle effects, known as micro-animations.
            </p>
            <p class="lato text-justify">
                These are subtle movements that show up when your website’s browsers  & components do a specific action. They still fill your pages with life, yet have a lighter impact on page loading time, and don’t distract your visitors from the layout of the website.
            </p>
            <p class="lato text-justify">
                In addition to functioning as guides on your website, these interactions can be used simply to add liveliness to your page and draw some ‘oohs’ and ‘’wows’ out of your web traffic.
            </p>
            <h5 class="mid-headers">Mobile-first Optimization</h5>
            <p class="lato mt-5 text-justify">
                With Google’s rollout of the mobile-first index in March 2018 and mobile speed update a few months later, there are officially new rules to the SEO (search engine optimisation) game. Now, bots will check out your website’s mobile version before the desktop one when deciding how to rank your site in the search results. Furthermore, loading speed is a factor in how they calculate the ranking of mobile sites. The translation: A lightning fast, fully optimized mobile site is your key to improving your rank on search engine displays and getting found on Google by more potential customers and followers.
            </p>
            <p class="lato text-justify">
                Luckily, taking the desktop version of your site mobile is checked off for Wix users, as any website you create automatically generates a mobile-friendly version, fully optimized for Google’s requirements. Once you have the structure, make sure you get rid of all the unnecessary content – as small screens can get crowded pretty quickly. Here is how Ryan Warrender, who worked as a Mobile UX Manager at Google, defines mobile success: “A user should know what to do and why they should stay on your mobile site in a moment’s glance.”
            </p>
            <p class="lato text-justify">
                A good way to figure out what should stay and what should go is to put yourself in your visitor’s shoes: Someone has just landed on your page. Is this element really needed for them to take your desired action? If the answer is “no,” you might as well remove it from your mobile-version (don’t worry – it won’t affect the desktop one). This is one of the many mobile website best practices you’ll find on this precious checklist.
            </p>
            <p class="lato text-justify">
                This year the UI/UX designers and UI/UX design firms will continue building up variety and search for ways to build effective user experiences. Millions of users use apps and websites as a part of their daily routine; they have different tastes and preferences, particular feelings of what is comfortable and looks nice for them. The more options for looks and features we design for them, the broader range of diverse options the global community of users, as well as designers, will get to find the ones which fit their specific needs and wishes.<br>
                <br>
                <strong>In addition, in case you accomplish in making a positive experience, the users will come back and thereby, boost the retention rate of your app.</strong>
